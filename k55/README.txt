description: Standard 5 payloads just showing off some cool kernel acces effects like drawing to the screen, displaying your screen onto a tiny screen, screen compresssion (idk how to describe it) and some other common virus tropes from this repositery. The destruction is set to 0 as it might take a bit off your cpu at some parts but if you just let it run then it will end up the same you started. Unstoppability 1 cause you can just taskkill it.
